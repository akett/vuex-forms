# Vuex Forms

> A comprehensive form management solution for Vue.js, built with Vuex in mind.

### 2022 UPDATE:

This repo should be considered defunct - you should not use it without good reason. There are now much better solutions available, namely projects which are compatible with more modern Vue workflows/concepts, such as [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/) and [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/).

This repo will be archived and left up for any legacy projects which may still rely on it.
